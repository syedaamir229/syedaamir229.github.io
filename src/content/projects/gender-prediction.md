# Behavior-Based Attribute Inference

**Organization**: Shahid (MBC Group)
**Role**: Data Science & Advanced Analytics
**Timeline**: July -- October 2025
**Industry**: Media & Entertainment (Data Science)
**Ownership**: End-to-end owner of feature engineering, model training, validation, and deployment handoff

**Impact Metrics**:

- Built an **XGBoost classification model** predicting user gender from viewing behavior patterns
- Achieved **75% accuracy** and **0.81 AUC** on a validation set of 700K single-adult-profile accounts
- Scored **9.5M adult profiles**, expanding demographic coverage from 22.7% (self-reported only) to **100% of engaged accounts**
- **5.8M new predictions** generated for profiles with no prior gender data
- Top predictive features: protagonist gender (16.6%), audience affinity (9.3%), and sub-genre preferences (5.5%)
- Model operates at **profile level** (not account level), enabling household-aware personalization

Declared profile attributes were incomplete for a meaningful portion of users. A behavior-based inference workflow was needed to improve usable audience context.

## Challenge

- **Missing profile fields**: Key attributes were incomplete for many users
- **Data quality variance**: Declared values were not always reliable in shared-account scenarios
- **Planning limitations**: Content and marketing teams needed broader audience context
- **Activation requirement**: Inferred signals had to be usable in existing targeting workflows

## Approach

- Engineered behavioral features from profile activity and content interaction patterns
- Trained and compared classification models using validated training subsets
- Evaluated model behavior across segments to ensure practical consistency
- Published inferred attributes as controlled downstream features for analytics and targeting use

## Results & Impact

- Audience analysis became more complete where declared attributes were sparse
- Teams gained additional context for planning and campaign design
- Behavioral signals were converted into a practical enrichment layer
- Outputs complemented clustering and other audience modeling workflows

## Tech Stack

- XGBoost, scikit-learn
- PySpark
- Databricks, Delta Lake
- MLflow (Unity Catalog model registry)
- SQL

## Reusable Pattern

This enrichment pattern is relevant when customer profiles are incomplete:

- **E-commerce**: Attribute enrichment for personalization and targeting
- **Fintech**: Behavior-based profile completion for segmentation support
- **Advertising**: Audience enrichment for campaign planning
- **Healthcare engagement**: Behavioral enrichment for communication strategies

## Additional Context

- Built in parallel with clustering initiatives to improve audience understanding depth
- Deployed with conservative usage guidance for downstream consumers
