Monitoring is where semantic-layer maturity becomes visible. Teams that only monitor refresh success miss the main problem: slow queries, capacity bottlenecks, and model drift that gradually reduce trust.

A practical monitoring system combines technical telemetry with operational actions.

*Monitoring only creates value when it triggers optimization actions, ownership, and measurable improvements.*

## What to Monitor

### Query performance signals

Track measures that reflect user experience and model efficiency:

- query duration percentiles
- heavy visual query frequency
- high-cardinality slice behavior

### Resource signals

Track infrastructure and engine pressure:

- memory pressure patterns
- CPU saturation windows
- processing durations by partition

### Refresh reliability signals

Track freshness and failure behavior:

- success and failure counts
- retry patterns
- delayed partition completion

### Metadata signals

Track usage and ownership context:

- dashboard and report usage
- top queried measure families
- ownership map for impacted areas

## Monitoring Architecture Pattern

A robust setup typically includes:

1. data collection from engine, jobs, and usage metadata
2. centralized metrics tables for historical analysis
3. threshold rules for alerting and triage
4. weekly review cycle that assigns optimization actions

This turns monitoring into a feedback loop rather than a passive dashboard.

## Optimization Playbook

When monitoring flags issues, use a structured response:

### Measure-level optimization

- simplify expensive expressions
- reduce repeated context transitions
- precompute heavy logic upstream where appropriate

### Model-level optimization

- review relationship directions and cardinality
- optimize partition grain and retention windows
- remove unused or redundant objects

### Report-level optimization

- reduce heavy visual combinations
- limit high-cardinality default queries
- align report patterns with semantic-model strengths

## Practical Alerting Priorities

Not all alerts should page immediately. A useful priority model:

- **P1**: refresh failure on business-critical datasets
- **P2**: severe query latency degradation during business hours
- **P3**: rising trend alerts for capacity or slow slices

This prevents alert fatigue while preserving fast response for high-impact issues.

## Operating Rhythm That Works

A weekly cycle is often enough for continuous improvement:

- review top incidents and slow-query clusters
- map incidents to model, refresh, or report causes
- assign fixes with owners and target dates
- review post-fix impact in next cycle

Over time this creates measurable stability gains and fewer surprise outages.

## Monitoring Implementation Blueprint

Set up one central telemetry table per signal family so performance trends can be queried historically.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ops.semantic_query_metrics (
  metric_ts TIMESTAMP,
  report_name STRING,
  query_name STRING,
  duration_ms BIGINT,
  rows_scanned BIGINT,
  status STRING
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ops.semantic_refresh_metrics (
  run_ts TIMESTAMP,
  table_name STRING,
  partition_name STRING,
  duration_sec BIGINT,
  rows_processed BIGINT,
  status STRING
);
```

## Alert Rules You Can Start With

1. refresh failure alert immediately on first failure
2. p95 query duration alert when over threshold for 3 consecutive intervals
3. partition processing alert when run time is 2x weekly baseline
4. stale-data alert when latest successful refresh age exceeds SLA

## Weekly Optimization SOP

1. review top 10 slow queries
2. map each query to KPI, model object, and report visual
3. assign action: DAX tuning, model tuning, or report tuning
4. rerun measurements after fix
5. close only when metrics return to baseline range

## Key Takeaway

A semantic layer is not finished after go-live. The strongest teams treat it as an operating system for metrics: instrumented, reviewed, and continuously optimized.
