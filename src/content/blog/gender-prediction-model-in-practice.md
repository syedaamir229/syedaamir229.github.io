Declared profile attributes are often incomplete. A practical inference model can improve coverage, but only if its outputs are validated and used with clear guardrails.

This model used behavioral signals to enrich profile attributes where declared values were missing or unreliable. It was built at Shahid (MBC Group), where only 22.7% of adult profiles had self-reported gender data. The goal was to expand that coverage to 100% of engaged accounts.

## Problem Setup

- Important audience attributes were sparsely populated.
- Shared-account behavior reduced confidence in declared fields.
- Planning teams needed broader contextual coverage.

The objective was enrichment for analysis and targeting support, not perfect identity prediction. Content and marketing teams needed usable demographic context to plan campaigns and understand audience composition, but the raw profile data had too many gaps to rely on directly.

## Feature Engineering: What Viewing Behavior Actually Tells You

The model was built on the premise that what someone watches carries more demographic signal than what they choose to fill in on a profile form. But it is not just about genre preferences. The features that mattered most were content-level attributes tied to viewing sessions.

The top predictive feature was protagonist gender, accounting for 16.6% of overall feature importance. This makes intuitive sense: the gender of on-screen leads correlates with audience composition, especially for drama and romance content that dominates MENA streaming catalogs. Next came audience affinity scores at 9.3%, which capture how closely a profile's viewing pattern matches known audience clusters. Sub-genre preferences contributed 5.5%, capturing finer distinctions than top-level genre labels alone.

The broader point: explicit profile fields like age or signup source were far less predictive than behavioral features derived from content metadata. Building those features required joining viewing logs against a content catalog enriched with attributes like cast composition, sub-genre tags, and audience affinity segments. The engineering work to get clean, profile-level behavioral features was as significant as the modeling itself.

## Approach

1. Build robust behavioral features from profile activity.
2. Train and compare classification candidates.
3. Evaluate by segment stability and practical consistency.
4. Publish inferred outputs as controlled downstream fields.

The final model used XGBoost, achieving 75% accuracy and 0.81 AUC on a validation set of 700K single-adult-profile accounts. That validation set was deliberately restricted to accounts where only one adult profile existed, reducing the noise introduced by shared-account behavior.

## Validation: What "Practical Consistency" Means

Accuracy on a held-out test set is table stakes. The harder question for an enrichment model is whether its predictions behave sensibly in production context.

Practical consistency meant three things. First, testing model predictions against known segments: if the model says a profile is female, does that profile's behavior align with what we already know about verified female users in the same cohort? Second, checking stability across different user cohorts and time periods. A model that predicts one way in January and flips in March is worse than useless for planning teams that build campaigns weeks in advance. Third, ensuring predictions did not flip-flop between scoring refreshes. If a profile gets re-scored weekly, the prediction should be stable unless the underlying behavior genuinely changes. Erratic predictions erode trust with downstream consumers faster than slightly lower accuracy would.

## Scale

The model scored 9.5M adult profiles, expanding demographic coverage from 22.7% to 100% of engaged accounts. Of those, 5.8M were entirely new predictions for profiles with no prior gender data at all. That is the real value: not marginally improving data you already have, but filling in the blanks where you previously had nothing.

The model operates at profile level rather than account level, which matters for a platform where multiple family members often share a single account. Profile-level scoring means you can distinguish viewing patterns within a household rather than averaging them together into noise.

## Guardrails That Matter

- Keep inferred fields explicitly labeled as inferred. Every downstream table carries a confidence flag and an `is_inferred` marker. No consumer should mistake a model prediction for a declared value.
- Avoid over-precision in downstream communication. A 75% accurate model should not be presented as ground truth in executive reporting.
- Monitor drift as behavior patterns change. Viewing habits shift with content releases, Ramadan schedules, and platform feature changes.
- Restrict high-stakes usage unless confidence and governance support it.

Beyond the standard controls, a few platform-specific considerations shaped how the model was deployed. Shared accounts are common on MENA streaming platforms like Shahid. When multiple people use the same profile, behavioral signals get mixed, and any single prediction carries lower confidence. The model's confidence scores reflect this: profiles with inconsistent viewing patterns receive lower confidence flags, and downstream consumers are expected to threshold accordingly.

Cultural context also matters. Viewing patterns in the MENA region do not map neatly onto Western baselines. Content catalogs, family viewing norms, and genre preferences differ meaningfully. A model trained on this platform's data captures those patterns, but it also means that assumptions from other markets about which genres or content attributes are gendered signals do not transfer directly. The feature engineering had to be grounded in this platform's actual data, not imported heuristics.

These controls help teams use enrichment responsibly. Inferred attributes expand what you can analyze, but they should never be treated with the same certainty as declared data.

## Outcome

Audience analysis became more complete, and planning workflows gained useful context in places where declared attributes were previously missing. The enrichment layer fed into campaign targeting, audience composition reporting, and downstream clustering models that previously operated on incomplete demographic inputs.

The broader takeaway is that inference models like this are not replacements for better data collection. They are stop-gap measures that make incomplete data more usable while you work on improving upstream capture. The model filled a real gap, but the long-term play is always to get more users to self-report, reduce friction in profile setup, and build trust that encourages voluntary disclosure. Inference buys you time and coverage. It does not eliminate the need for good data practices upstream.
