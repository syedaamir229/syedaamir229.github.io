The move from BI to data science was not a clean handoff from one role to another. It was a transition period where both responsibilities coexisted.

## The Overlap Period

For roughly six months, my weeks had a predictable split. Mornings were still BI -- fielding dashboard requests, fixing broken refreshes, reviewing metric definitions with stakeholders. Afternoons shifted toward feature engineering, writing transformation logic against the same subscriber tables I already knew well, but now shaping them for model inputs instead of report filters.

The dual-role tension was real but manageable. The BI side had established processes and stakeholder expectations. The data science side was exploratory and less predictable. Some weeks the balance tipped heavily toward BI when a critical reporting cycle hit. Other weeks I could spend full days on feature pipelines. The key was that neither side was neglected long enough to lose trust.

Working at Shahid (MBC Group) meant the data volumes and business urgency were high on both fronts. Dashboards powered weekly executive reviews. Models were expected to drive subscriber retention and personalization. There was no luxury of pausing one to focus on the other.

## What Changed

- **Deliverables shifted from dashboards to models and features.** The first ML deliverable was a behavior-based gender inference model -- predicting subscriber gender from viewing patterns when demographic data was missing. It was a classification problem, but the harder work was building the behavioral features that made it useful. After that came viewing cluster models for content personalization, and eventually a profile-level feature store that enriched subscriber records across multiple downstream systems.

- **Evaluation moved from visual validation to model diagnostics and segment behavior.** Instead of checking whether a chart looked right, I was evaluating precision-recall tradeoffs, checking whether model predictions held across subscriber segments, and validating that inferred attributes aligned with known ground-truth samples.

- **Success criteria expanded from reporting speed to decision impact.** A good dashboard was one that loaded fast, showed accurate numbers, and answered the business question. A good model had to do all of that and also change a downstream decision -- trigger a CRM campaign, adjust a content recommendation, or flag an at-risk subscriber for intervention.

## What Did Not Change

- Data-model discipline stayed central.
- Stakeholder translation remained critical.
- Metric trust was still non-negotiable.

The biggest misconception is that BI skills become irrelevant in DS work. In practice, they reduce failure risk. Knowing how to build governed dimension tables, how to define lifecycle logic consistently, and how to communicate metric limitations to business stakeholders -- these are exactly the skills that prevent ML projects from producing outputs nobody trusts.

## Turning Point

The transition became durable once feature engineering and inference workflows started sharing the same governed entities as BI. The clearest example was subscriber-level features powering both a churn dashboard and a churn prediction model. The churn dashboard showed monthly attrition rates by plan type, region, and tenure. The churn model used the same `dim_subscriber` table -- with lifecycle status, subscription start date, and plan history -- as input features. Same governed tables, different outputs. When a stakeholder asked "why does the model say this subscriber is at risk?" I could point to the same fields they already saw in the dashboard. That traceability made the model's outputs credible to teams that were used to dashboard-level clarity.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

A few things go wrong when this kind of transition is not handled carefully:

1. **Building an ML pipeline with its own data model.** This is the most common failure. The data science team creates its own subscriber table with slightly different lifecycle definitions, different date cutoffs, or a different way of handling trial accounts. The model works fine in isolation, but its numbers disagree with the BI dashboards. Stakeholders notice. Trust erodes. The fix is to enforce shared entity definitions from day one.

2. **Dropping BI responsibilities too early.** If the dashboards stop being maintained or metric definitions drift while attention shifts to ML, business teams lose confidence in the data function overall. They will not trust model outputs from someone whose dashboards started breaking. The overlap period exists for a reason -- it builds credibility for the new work by preserving trust in the existing work.

3. **Treating model accuracy as the only success metric.** A model can have strong accuracy on a holdout set and still fail in production because the output format does not match what downstream systems need, or because the predictions are not actionable at the business cadence. Validating operational fit matters as much as validating statistical performance.

## Practical Advice for Similar Transitions

- **Do not drop BI foundations too early.** Keep maintaining the dashboards, keep attending the metric review meetings, keep answering the ad-hoc questions. The trust you have built in BI is transferable to DS, but only if it is not abandoned. A well-maintained dashboard is proof that you understand the data -- and that proof matters when you start asking stakeholders to trust a model.

- **Keep one source of truth for key entities and lifecycle logic.** This means subscriber definitions, event taxonomies, date spine logic, and segment rules should live in governed tables that both BI and DS consume. If you let each workstream define its own version of "active subscriber," you will spend more time reconciling numbers than building models.

- **Pair model metrics with business-readiness checks.** An F1 score is necessary but not sufficient. Before calling a model ready, check whether its output can be consumed by the activation layer -- CRM tools, recommendation engines, or operational dashboards. If the output needs manual transformation before it is useful, it is not ready.

- **Communicate limitations as clearly as results.** When presenting model outputs, lead with what the model does not cover. Stakeholders respect transparency more than inflated claims. If the model works well for one subscriber segment but poorly for another, say so upfront. That honesty is what separates a sustainable ML practice from a demo that never gets deployed.

## What Came After

This transition phase set up the later AI automation systems. The governed data layer, the shared entity definitions, the trust-preserving habits -- all of these became the foundation for CRM automation, profile enrichment, and operational ML at scale.
